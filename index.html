	<p>Hello. Welcome to the CTF challenge! What is a CTF challenge? A CTF or Capture-the-Flag challenge is a test of computing skills. There are many different flavors of CTF challenges including jeopardy and attack-and-defend. This CTF challenge
		will be like a digital scavenger hunt! I am not testing your computing knowledge with this challenge, rather your resourcefulness. This is meant to be a fun activity and no prior knowledge is required.
	<p>You will advance through various stages. Each stage will have a "flag" or phrase which will lead you to the next stage. Every stage has a dedicated webpage. Each flag/phrase is the end of the URL for the following webpage that provides
		information about the next stage. All of the URLs begin "https://dargen.io/ctf/". The flag goes after the last slash (/). For example, if the phrase was "cow", you would go to the web address: <a
			href="https://dargen.io/ctf/cow">https://dargen.io/ctf/cow</a>.</p>
	<p>The final stage will direct you to a Google Form where you will submit your final flag. Good luck!</p>
